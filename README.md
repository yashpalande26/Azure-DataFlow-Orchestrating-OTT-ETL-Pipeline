# Azure-DataFlow-Orchestrating-OTT-ETL-Pipeline

In this Azure-based project, I orchestrated a robust ETL pipeline for an OTT platform, seamlessly transitioning data from an on-premise file storage to Azure's cloud environment. Leveraging Azure Data Factory, I automated data ingestion into Azure Data Lake, enabling a smooth transition from a non-cloud to a cloud environment. 
For data transformation, Azure Synapse Analytics Notebook was employed, utilizing Pyspark code for efficient data processing and transformation. The entire process was orchestrated using Azure Data Factory, ensuring flexibility and automation. The final phase involved loading the transformed data into Azure SQL Database, achieving structured and cleansed data for reporting. 
Power BI was utilized for comprehensive data reporting, resulting in a well-structured ETL pipeline from on-premise data to insightful reporting.
This project highlights my expertise in Azure services, ETL orchestration, and data-driven decision-making.
