1) 
- Incremental Loading : (Extracting date)No repetition of file, while loading. By using Filter by last modified option.
- Extracting name from the file name.(If file name is date, we can extract that name, if the date is equal to todays date we can consider that as today's file)
- To load the data from on-premise DS to azure DL we have done that by incremental loading.

2) 
- synapse is having much more feature then the data factor, It can perform all the data operation like DF additional with transformation activities.

3) 
- Creating a spark spool inside our azure synAlt(To boost the performance of our big data analytics load).

4)
- Orchestrating all the pipeline, To make them automated, This can be done by the help of trigger(trigger = It is the activity which will invoke the entire pipeline)
- 3 Type of Trigger: 1) tumbling window 2)scheduled 3)event based
Here we are make use of a tumbling window (As we are taking data from on-premise so we can't use event based trigged)
- tumbling window: It execute the pipeline at a pre-define periodic interval
